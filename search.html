  It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. <br>
  Examples of such errors include a grader incorrectly summing points or incorrectly marking something not completed.<br>
  Grades based on the judgement of the grader, except in extremely extenuating circumstances, will not be regraded. <br>
  In particular, grades for categories like "Site is Visually Appealing" will not be regraded.<br>
  All regrade requests must be submitted by email to cse330ta@gmail.com within one week of grading. <br>
  Requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered. Requests must contain a specific explanation of the error, including filenames and line numbers of code, if appropriate.
